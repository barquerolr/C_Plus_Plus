/****************************************************************************
* Project 3: pgm3.cpp â€“ simulating a falling object
*
* Programmer: Luis Barquero
*
* Due Date: information that you must provide
*
* EGRE 246 Fall 2016
*
* I pledge I neither gave nor received unauthorized aid on this program.
*
* Description: Project will take an initial height, and using Euler's Formula, it will output the time and the speed of impact in both ft/sec and mph.
*
* Inputs: Initial Height.
*
* Output: Time, impact speed(ft/sec), impact speed(mph).
